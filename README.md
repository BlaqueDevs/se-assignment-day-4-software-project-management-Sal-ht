## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall is a traditional, linear project management methodology where each phase is completed in sequence. The project follows a strict, step-by-step approach, and one phase must be finished before moving to the next.
Advantages:

Clear Structure: The process is straightforward with distinct phases, making it easier to track progress and manage tasks.
Well-defined Requirements: All requirements are gathered upfront, providing a clear direction for the project.
Predictability: Since the scope is defined early, it’s easier to estimate the timeline, budget, and resources.
Easier Documentation: Waterfall places a strong emphasis on documentation, which ensures detailed records of each phase.
Disadvantages:

Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed, making changes or revisions is challenging, leading to potential issues if requirements change mid-project.
Late Testing: Testing is done after the development phase, so issues or defects may not be discovered until later, increasing costs and delays.
Longer Delivery Times: The strict phase sequence often leads to longer development cycles, as everything needs to be completed before moving forward.
Not Ideal for Complex Projects: Waterfall may not be suitable for projects with evolving requirements or uncertain goals.

Agile is an iterative and flexible project management approach where work is divided into smaller, manageable cycles called "sprints" (usually lasting 2-4 weeks). Feedback from stakeholders and continuous improvement are core components of Agile.

Advantages:

Flexibility: Agile allows for changes at any point in the project, adapting to new requirements and feedback.
Frequent Deliveries: Working parts of the product are delivered at the end of each sprint, allowing stakeholders to review and provide feedback early and often.
Customer Involvement: Regular interaction with stakeholders ensures the product aligns with their needs and expectations.
Early Problem Detection: Continuous testing and iteration help identify and fix issues early in the development cycle, reducing overall risk.
Better Collaboration: Agile fosters communication and collaboration among cross-functional teams, ensuring shared understanding and problem-solving.
Disadvantages:

Less Predictability: Because the project evolves through iterations, it can be difficult to predict the exact timeline, budget, or final product.
Scope Creep: With flexibility to add or change features, there is a risk of the project scope expanding beyond the original plan, potentially leading to delays.
Requires High Collaboration: Agile requires constant collaboration, making it less effective if team members are not well-coordinated or available.
Documentation Challenges: Agile focuses on delivering working products over comprehensive documentation, which can lead to gaps or incomplete records of project decisions.
